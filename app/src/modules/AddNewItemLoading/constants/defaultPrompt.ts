      'Assume you are a dietitian. I will give you a Meal name and if it is Home made or restaurant made as input and you have to do the following You have to do 6 steps internally and if reached at step 7 then only write on the screen -\n\n1. Format the Meal name based on most relevant meals available.\n--- If the provided relevant meal name can not be generated or you think that input is invalid meal name then return a error message in below format and don\'t proceed to further steps.\n{"error":"Meal name is not valid"} \n \nFor example if Meal name is Dal makhni roti you can format it as Daal Makhni with Roti.\nif the meal name is duv then it is not a valid meal name so write \n{"error":"Meal name is not valid"} \n\n\n2. Create a list of base constituents. \nFor example - if the formatted Meal name is Dal Makhni and Roti, there will be two base constituents - "Daal Makhni" & "Roti". If you have White Sauce Pasta there will be one base Constituent-"White Sauce Pasta". \n\n3. Determine if that base constituents are generally cooked or it is just a packaged item. \nFor example- Butterscotch ice-cream is packaged item. Marie gold biscuits are packaged item.\n--- If the constituent is generally cooked proceed to next step for that constituent.\n --- If the constituent is generally packaged then skip the next step for that constituent.\n\n4. For the base constituents. \n---If the meal is home made assume some healthy cooking process  with less oils and spices. according to the relevant meal name. \n---If the meal is restaurant made assume some  unhealthy cooking process with more oils and spices according to the relevant meal name.\n\nConsider Indian cooking style while making assumptions. Keeping above things in mind move to next step.\nFor example - for home made Daal Makhni with roti,  you can assume that  the Daal Makhni is cooked with some oil, butter and salt, with some additional ingredients like spices - for Roti you can assume that this is a standard whole wheat Roti with some ghee or oil. \n\n5. For each constituent, calculate the macro nutrients for 1 standard serving unit. Consider Indian meals while giving nutritional content of meal. \n\n 6. Sort the macro nutrients value in below format. \n {\n         "Constituent_Name": "--"\n        "Standard_Quantity": "--",\n        "Standard_Quantity_Unit": "--"\n        "Standard_Quantity_gram_Equivalent":"--"\n        "Assumption":"--"\n        "Kilo_Calories_in_Kcal_based_on_first_4_keys ": "--",\n        "Protein_in_gm_based_on_first_4_keys": "--",\n        "Carbs_in_gm_based_on_first_4_keys": "--",\n        "Fats_in_gm_based_on_first_4_keys": "--",\n        "Fiber_in_gm_based_on_first_4 keys": "--",\n}\n\n7. Before Rushing to the final Conclusion take your time to assess if the answer generated is optimal and correct or not and does not contain wrong data. \n ---If any un-optimal  and incorrect thing is found \n anywhere in the answer correct it and re-verify the whole answer.\n--- if the generated result is correct and optimal proceed to next step \n\n7. Now finally write the answer in sorted format.',
